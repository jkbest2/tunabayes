  abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.2.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propa- gation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line, through R using the RStan package, or through Python using the PyStan package. All three interfaces support sampling or optimization-based inference and analysis, and RStan and PyStan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, and data I/O.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

Fish stocks are assessed using biological and fisheries data with the goal of estimating either their total population or biomass. Stock assessment models also make it possible to predict how stocks will respond to varying levels of fishing pressure in the future. Such tools are essential with overfishing now reducing stocks and employment worldwide, with in turn many serious social, economic, and environmental implications. Increasingly, a state-space framework is being used in place of deterministic and standard parametric stock assessment models. These efforts have not only had considerable impact on fisheries management but have also advanced the supporting statistical theory and inference tools as well as the required software. An application of such techniques to the North Sea cod stock highlights what should be considered best practices for science-based fisheries management.},

JABBA can be used for biomass dynamic stock assessment applications, and has emerged from the development of a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework, already applied in stock assessments of sharks, tuna, and billfishes around the world. JABBA presents a unifying, flexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Specific emphasis has been placed on flexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically fitting multiple catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or Pella-Tomlinson production functions; 4) options to fix or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model fit diagnostics and stock status results. As a case study, JABBA is applied to the 2017 assessment input data for South Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We envision that JABBA will become a widely used, open-source stock assessment tool, readily improved and modified by the global scientific community.},

The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50\% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.},

  abstract = {Dynamically rescaled Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (DRHMC) is introduced as a computationally fast and easily implemented method for performing full Bayesian analysis in hierarchical statistical models. The method relies on introducing a modiﬁed parameterisation so that the re-parameterised target distribution has close to constant scaling properties, and thus is easily sampled using standard (Euclidian metric) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Provided that the parameterisations of the conditional distributions specifying the hierarchical model are “constant information parameterisations” (CIP), the relation between the modiﬁed- and original parameterisation is bijective, explicitly computed and admit exploitation of sparsity in the numerical linear algebra involved. CIPs for a large catalogue of statistical models are presented, and from the catalogue, it is clear that many CIPs are currently routinely used in statistical computing. A relation between the proposed methodology and a class of explicitly integrated Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods is discussed. The methodology is illustrated on several example models, including a model for inﬂation rates with multiple levels of non-linearly dependent latent variables.},

The computational burden can be reduced substantially by analytically integrating over at least two "nuisance parameters" that occur in most assessment models: the observation error variance and the catchability coefficient. This simplification allows the analyst and manager to focus more easily on population parameters (stock size, slope of recruitment curve) that are of direct policy interest., La distribution bayésienne de probabilité a posteriori constitue un outil puissant pour représenter les incertitudes dans les évaluations des stocks halieutiques, et peut être calculée pour des paramètres clés de la population et des politiques dans pratiquement n'importe quel modèle de la dynamique des populations. Toutefois, ce calcul est trop compliqué lorsqu'il faut attribuer des probabilités à une large grille de combinaisons de paramètres. Le fardeau du calcul peut être fortement réduit si on fait une intégration analytique d'au moins deux paramètres dérangeants qui sont présents dans la plupart des modèles d'évaluation : la variance de l'erreur d'observation et le coefficient de capturabilité. Cette simplification permet à l'analyste et au gestionnaire de s'intéresser plus directement aux paramètres sur les populations (taille du stock, pente de la courbe du recrutement) qui présentent un intérêt direct pour les politiques.},

Models may be specified either textually via the BUGS language or pictorially using a graphical interface called DoodleBUGS. WinBUGS processes the model specification and constructs an object-oriented representation of the model. The software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu commands, through which the model may then be analysed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific applications that form an apparently seamless interface with WinBUGS for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface with WinBUGS at a lower level by incorporating new object types that may be used by WinBUGS without knowledge of the modules in which they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require access to, or even recompilation of, the WinBUGS source-code.},

  abstract = {A key challenge for analyzing fisheries time-series data has been to incorporate sources of uncertainty such as process error, observation error, and model-structure uncertainty. Recent years have seen promising advances in methods for handling the first two together in a state-space framework, but likelihood calculations for state-space models require high-dimensional integrals, which make their use computationally challenging. The first section of this paper reviews model-fitting methods that use a state-space model structure, including errors-in-variables methods, Bayesian methods that do and do not use the state-space likelihood, and the possibility of classical likelihood analysis with nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. It also discusses the relationship between true likelihood calculations and errors-in-variables likelihoods, as well as the role of Monte Carlo methods in implementing Bayesian and/or state-space model analyses. The second section introduces a numerical method for calculating state-space likelihoods without Monte Carlo methods and gives examples in a classical maximum-likelihood framework. The method is applicable when the dimension of the state space at each time step is low. Although recent advances in model-fitting and analysis methods are promising, inferences from noisy data and complex processes will continue to be variable and uncertain.},

Estimation performance is evaluated in terms of bias, precision, and reliability measured by the extreme tail-area probability and the mean highest posterior density interval. The PEM generally performs poorest of the three methods in terms of the these performance metrics. In contrast, the OEM is precise, but under-represents uncertainty. The OEM is outperformed by the SSM in terms of its ability to provide posterior distributions which adequately capture parameter uncertainty. It is key to consider the above four metrics when comparing estimation performance in a Bayesian context.

  abstract = {We evaluate a method for fitting models to time series of population abundances that incorporates both process noise and observation error in a likelihood framework. The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used. We refer to the method as the “numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method” and compare it to two common methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model, the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods. We also evaluated the utility of each method for model selection by fitting simulated data to both models and using information criteria for selection. The NISS and LSOE methods showed a strong bias toward selecting the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt, even when data were generated with the Beverton-Holt. It remains unclear whether the LSPN method is generally superior for model selection or has fortuitously better biases in this particular case. These results suggest that information criteria are best used with caution for nonlinear population models with short time series. Finally we evaluated the convergence of likelihood ratios to theoretical asymptotic distributions. Agreement with asymptotic distributions was very good for stable-point Ricker parameters, less accurate for two-cycle and four-cycle Ricker parameters, and least accurate for the Beverton-Holt model. The numerically integrated state-space method has a number of advantages over least squares methods and offers a useful tool for connecting models and data and ecology.},

The total-error approach outperforms the observation-error estimator conventionally used to fit dynamic production models, and the performance of a Kalman filter based estimator is particularly poor. Although the NISS estimator is the best-performing estimator considered, its estimates of quantities of management interest are severely biased and highly imprecise for some of the scenarios considered., Une simulation de Monte Carlo permet d'évaluer quatre méthodes d'ajustement des modèles de production, dont trois qui prennent en compte les effets des erreurs dans la dynamique de population (erreurs de processus) et dans l'indexation de la population (erreurs d'observation).

The only exception to this result is when data are provided with unrealistically large contrasts in effort and catch per unit effort over time. The implication of these findings is that simple production models should often be used in stock assessments based on catch/effort data, even when more realistic and structurally correct models are available to the analyst; the best choice depends on how much contrast has occurred in the historical effort and catch per unit effort data, rather than on prior knowledge about which model structure is biologically more realistic., Les auteurs ont utilisé des données simulées pour évaluer le rendement de plans d'estimation de l'effort de pêche optimum, à l'aide d'un simple modèle de production de stock et du modèle de R.

Indeed, this application requires just 18 lines of code in its entirety and does not require the programmer to know the formulae for any prior density functions or likelihoods. Consequently, we suggest that this methodology may permit the implementation phase of nonlinear state-space modeling to be relegated, thereby allowing more effort to be devoted..., La modélisation explicite de la variabilité des processus en dynamique des pêches découle de l'intention de rendre plus réalistes les modèles d'évaluation des stocks, et beaucoup de recherches ont été consacrées récemment aux caractéristiques computationnelles de l'ajustement des modèles état-espace.

Both economists and ecologists have different opinions on whether this approach provides an adequate biological basis for economic analysis. This study takes an age-structured population model and shows how, under equilibrium conditions, it determines the surplus production model. The surplus production model is then used to solve an optimal feedback policy for a generic optimal harvesting problem. Next, it is assumed that the fishery manager applies this feedback policy even though the fish population actually evolves according to the age-structured model. This framework is applied to the widow rockfish, Atlantic menhaden, and Pacific halibut fisheries. Population age-structure contains information on future harvest possibilities. The surplus production model neglects this information and may lead to major deviations between the expected and actual outcomes especially under multiple steady states and nonlinearities.},

  abstract = {Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will cause drastic changes in the system trajectory1. This sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional statistical methods2, this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the covariance matrix of the statistics, given model parameters, allowing the construction of a ‘synthetic likelihood’ that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one further post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply the method to establish the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in Nicholson’s classic blowfly experiments3,4,5.},

(1953), where it was used to simulate the distribution of states for a system of idealized molecules. Not long after, another approach to molecular simulation was introduced (Alder and Wainwright, 1959), in which the motion of the molecules was deterministic, following Newton’s laws of motion, which have an elegant formalization as Hamiltonian dynamics. For finding the properties of bulk materials, these approaches are asymptotically equivalent, since even in a deterministic simulation, each local region of the material experiences effectively random influences from distant regions. Despite the large overlap in their application areas, the MCMC and molecular dynamics approaches have continued to coexist in the following decades (see Frenkel and Smit, 1996).},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

We incorporate these estimators to upgrade both the univariate and multivariate Gelman-Rubin statistics, leading to increased stability in MCMC termination time. An immediate advantage is that our new Gelman-Rubin statistic can be calculated for a single chain. In addition, we establish a relationship between the Gelman-Rubin statistic and effective sample size. Leveraging this relationship, we develop a principled cutoff criterion for the Gelman-Rubin statistic. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our improved diagnostic via examples.},

  abstract = {Many stock assessments heavily rely on indices of relative abundance derived from fisheries-dependent catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate different CPUE standardization methods under varying scenarios of data generating processes. Here, we evaluated nine CPUE standardization methods offering contrasting treatments of spatio-temporal variation, ranging from the basic generalized linear model (GLM) method not integrating a year-area interaction term to a sophisticated method using the spatio-temporal modeling platform VAST. We compared the performance of these methods against simulated data constructed to mimic the processes generating fisheries-dependent information for Atlantic blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), a common bycatch population in pelagic longline fisheries. Data were generated using a longline data simulator for different population trajectories (increasing, decreasing, and static). These data were further subsampled to mimic an observer program where trips rather than sets form the sampling frame, with or without a bias towards trips with low catch rates, which might occur if the presence of an observer alters fishing behavior to avoid bycatch. The spatio-temporal modeling platform VAST achieved the best performance in simulation, namely generally had one of the lowest biases, one of the lowest mean absolute errors (MAEs), and 50\% confidence interval coverage closest to 50\%. Generalized additive models accounting for spatial autocorrelation at a broad spatial scale (one of the lowest MAEs and one of the lowest biases) and, to a lesser extent, non-spatial delta-lognormal GLMs including a year-area interaction as a random effect (one of the lowest MAEs and one of the best confidence interval coverages) also performed adequately. The VAST method provided the most comprehensive and consistent treatment of spatio-temporal variation, in contrast with methods that simply weight predictions by large spatial areas, where it is critical, but difficult, to get the a priori spatial stratification correct before weighting. Next, we applied the CPUE standardization methods to real data collected by the National Marine Fisheries Service Pelagic Observer Program. The indices of relative abundance predicted from real observer data were relatively similar across CPUE standardization methods for the period 1998–2017 and suggested that the blue marlin population of the Atlantic declined over the period 1998–2004 and was relatively stable afterwards. As spatio-temporal variation related to environmental changes or depletion becomes increasingly necessary to consider, greater use of spatio-temporal models for standardizing fisheries-dependent CPUE data will likely be warranted.},

  abstract = {State-space estimation methods are increasingly used in ecology to estimate productivity and abundance of natural populations while accounting for variability in both population dynamics and measurement processes. However, functional forms for population dynamics and density dependence often will not match the true biological process, and this may degrade the performance of state-space methods. We therefore developed a Bayesian semiparametric state-space model, which uses a Gaussian process (GP) to approximate the population growth function. This offers two benefits for population modeling. First, it allows data to update a specified “prior” on the population growth function, while reverting to this prior when data are uninformative. Second, it allows variability in population dynamics to be decomposed into random errors around the population growth function (“process error”) and errors due to the mismatch between the specified prior and estimated growth function (“model error”). We used simulation modeling to illustrate the utility of GP methods in state-space population dynamics models. Results confirmed that the GP model performs similarly to a conventional state-space model when either (1) the prior matches the true process or (2) data are relatively uninformative. However, GP methods improve estimates of the population growth function when the function is misspecified. Results also demonstrated that the estimated magnitude of “model error” can be used to distinguish cases of model misspecification. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for GP methods in other state-space models, including age and length-structured, meta-analytic, and individual-movement models.},

  abstract = {Conventional biomass dynamics models express next year’s biomass as this year’s biomass plus surplus production less catch. These models are typically applied to species with several age-classes but it is unclear how well they perform for short-lived species with low survival and high recruitment variation. Two alternative versions of the standard biomass dynamics model (Standard) were constructed for short-lived species by ignoring the ‘old biomass’ term (Annual), and assuming that the biomass at the start of the next year depends on density-dependent processes that are a function of that biomass (Stock-recruit). These models were fitted to catch and effort data for the grooved tiger prawn Penaeus semisulcatus using a hierarchical Bayesian technique. The results from the biomass dynamics models were compared with those from more complicated weekly delay-difference models. The analyses show that: the Standard model is flexible for short-lived species; the Stock-recruit model provides the most parsimonious fit; simple biomass dynamics models can provide virtually identical results to data-demanding models; and spatial variability in key population dynamics parameters exists for P. semisulacatus. The method outlined in this paper provides a means to conduct quantitative population assessments for data-limited short-lived species.},

  abstract = {Appropriate inference for stocks or species with low-quality data (poor data) or limited data (data poor) is extremely important. Hierarchical Bayesian methods are especially applicable to small-area, small-sample-size estimation problems because they allow poor-data species to borrow strength from species with good-quality data. We used a hammerhead shark complex as an example to investigate the advantages of using hierarchical Bayesian models in assessing the status of poor-data and data-poor exploited species. The hammerhead shark complex (Sphyrna spp.) along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States is composed of three species: the scalloped hammerhead (S. lewini), the great hammerhead (S. mokarran), and the smooth hammerhead (S. zygaena) sharks. The scalloped hammerhead comprises 70–80\% of the catch and has catch and relative abundance data of good quality, whereas great and smooth hammerheads have relative abundance indices that are both limited and of low quality presumably because of low stock density and limited sampling. Four hierarchical Bayesian state-space surplus production models were developed to simulate variability in population growth rates, carrying capacity, and catchability of the species. The results from the hierarchical Bayesian models were considerably more robust than those of the nonhierarchical models. The hierarchical Bayesian approach represents an intermediate strategy between traditional models that assume different population parameters for each species and those that assume all species share identical parameters. Use of the hierarchical Bayesian approach is suggested for future hammerhead shark stock assessments and for modeling fish complexes with species-specific data, because the poor-data species can borrow strength from the species with good data, making the estimation more stable and robust.},

A wide range of estimation methods for such models are available to ecologists, however it is not always clear, which is the appropriate method to choose. To this end, three approaches to estimation in the theta logistic model for population dynamics were benchmarked by Wang (2007). Similarly, we examine and compare the estimation performance of three alternative methods using simulated data. The first approach is to partition the state-space into a finite number of states and formulate the problem as a hidden Markov model (HMM). The second method uses the mixed effects modeling and fast numerical integration framework of the AD Model Builder (ADMB) open-source software. The third alternative is to use the popular Bayesian framework of BUGS. The study showed that state and parameter estimation performance for all three methods was largely identical, however with BUGS providing overall wider credible intervals for parameters than HMM and ADMB confidence intervals.},

Ideally, assessments involve fitting population dynamics models to fishery and monitoring data to provide estimates of time-trajectories of biomass and fishing mortality in absolute terms and relative to biological reference points such as BMSY and FMSY, along with measures of uncertainty. Some stock assessments are conducted using software developed for a specific stock or group of stocks. However, increasingly, stock assessments are being conducted using packages developed for application to several taxa and across multiple regions. We review the range of packages used to conduct assessments of fish and invertebrate stocks in the United States because these assessments tend to have common goals, and need to provide similar outputs for decision making. Sixteen packages are considered, five based on surplus production models, one based on a delay-difference model, and the remainder based on age-structured models. Most of the packages are freely available for use by analysts in the US and around the world, have been evaluated using simulations, and can form the basis for forecasts. The packages differ in their ease of use and the types of data inputs they can use. This paper highlights the benefits of stock assessment packages in terms of allowing analysts to explore many assessment configurations and facilitating the peer-review of assessments. It also highlights the disadvantages associated with the use of packages for conducting assessments. Packages with the most options and greatest flexibility are the most difficult to use, and see the greatest development of auxiliary tools to facilitate their use.},

To date, changes in target species have been incorporated in stock assessments at two different levels in analyses. First, these changes are taken into account during the parameterization of generalized linear models used to compute the CPUE index standardization. Second, changes in target species are directly incorporated as a time-varying catchability parameter during the fitting of the dynamic model used for the assessment. Here, we present an alternative method for this incorporation by specifying a single change point in the stationary distribution of the catchability coefficient in a Bayesian state-space production model. Two models were fitted to the time series of the south Atlantic blue shark (Prionace glauca) stock. In one of the models, only one catchability coefficient was estimated. In the other model, a change point was included, and two catchability coefficients were estimated, one before the change point, and the other after. Despite the latter model introducing an extra parameter, it produced a significantly better fit than the modeling approach without the change point. Although including a single change point in the catchability coefficient had no significant impact on the status of south Atlantic blue shark (which is still above BMSY), it provided a robust way of accounting for changes in catchability as a result of fishermen changing target species.},

In this context, it is important to consider model selection uncertainty because ignoring it can lead to unreliable estimates and overconfident inferences. For this study, four Bayesian surplus production models with symmetric or asymmetric production functions and either a constant or hierarchical time-varying intrinsic growth rate (r) were developed using data for Pacific blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) and Western and Central North Pacific striped marlin (Kajikia audax). The uncertainty resulting from model selection was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation techniques to examine the consistency of model estimates within (self-tests) and among (cross-tests) the alternative models. Specifically, these tests evaluated the performance of the deviance information criterion (DIC) and Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The results of the simulation tests suggested that mis-specification of time-varying r can lead to large estimation errors for biomass and management quantities and that DIC may not reliably identify the true data-generating model. Although BMA did not provide more accurate point estimates than just selecting the data-generating model, it did provide a more accurate characterization of uncertainty in model results. Our study shows the value of using simulations to evaluate model performance and to account for model selection uncertainty.},

Most importantly, BSP2 provides a state-space implementation of the deterministic Bayesian generalized surplus production model found in BSP. BSP2 models both process error in the dynamics equations to account for the effects of, e.g., interannual variation in recruitment, and error in predicted observations. BPS2 provides outputs to enable the computation of Bayes factors (BFs). BFs show Bayes posterior weights for different models and can be particularly important when structurally different models suggest different interpretations of stock status. A generalized production function implementation (i.e., the Fletcher model) is incorporated in which the ratio of the most productive stock size to carrying capacity can be set at hypothesized values other than the Schaefer model value of 0.5. The software can accommodate a variety of different priors for key parameters including carrying capacity (K), the maximum rate of population increase (r), and the ratio of stock biomass in the initial year to carrying capacity (Binit/K).},

The logistic model offers simplicity, but concern has been expressed that its fixed model shape may bias estimates of quantities of management interest. Here, I compare results from the logistic estimator used by ICCAT to those from an otherwise equivalent generalized (Pella–Tomlinson) production-model estimator. Following initial estimation with nonlinear least-squares, a resistant fitting method was used to identify statistical outliers, and both models were refit with outliers removed. The estimate of model shape from the generalized model was then close to the logistic, and estimates of stock status from the two estimators were similar. A simulation study conditioned on the trimmed generalized fit suggests that any systematic estimation error caused by assuming logistic shape for this stock is small. Moreover, the generalized estimator was sensitive to outlying observations and thus less precise than the logistic estimator, and it exhibited larger median proportional unsigned error. Sensitivity to outliers and lack of precision in an estimator make it more likely to provide misleading estimates in a given analysis; therefore, if the generalized production model with estimated shape parameter is used in stock assessment, it should be applied with skepticism and in conjunction with the more robust logistic form. Unless a good external estimate of model shape is available, the logistic model appears more suitable for routine assessment use on stocks similar to swordfish.},

This population was heavily exploited in 20th century modern commercial whaling operations. After more than 30 years of protection, its present status remains unknown. A deterministic sex and age-aggregated population dynamics model was used to estimate the pre-exploitation population size (K), the maximum net recruitment rate (rmax), the maximum depletion level (Nmin/K), and other quantities of interest of BSA. Input data included modern whaling catch series, absolute estimates of abundance, observed growth rates and indices of relative abundance. A Bayesian statistical method was used to calculate probability distributions for the model parameters. Prior distributions were set on rmax – an uninformative (Uniform [0, 0.106]) and an informative (Normal [0.067, 0.042]) – and on the population size in 2005 – N2005 (Uniform [500, 22,000]). A total of 10,000 samples were used to compute the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters using the Sampling-Importance-Resampling algorithm. Sensitivity of model outputs to the priors on rmax, a genetic constraint, data inclusion and catch allocation scenarios was investigated. Medians of the posterior probability distributions of quantities of interest for the base case scenario were: rmax = 0.069 (95\% probability intervals [PI] = 0.013–0.104), K = 24,558 (95\% PI = 22,791–31,118), Nmin/K = 2\% (PI = 0.31\%–12.5\%), N2006/ K = 27.4\% (PI = 18.3\%–39.5\%), N2020/K = 61.8\% (PI = 23.8\%–88.6\%), and N2040/K = 97.3\% (PI = 31.6\%–99.9\%). Despite apparent recovery in the past three decades, the western South Atlantic humpback whale population is still low relative to its pre-exploitation size and requires continued conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Surplus-production modeling has often assumed equilibrium conditions, although stocks are rarely thought to be in equilibrium. This paper describes a simple non-equilibrium approach (ASPIC) to fitting a logistic production model to catch and effort data. From such data, ASPIC provides estimates of the two logistic parameters r and K , catchability q, and stock biomass Bₜ in the first year of the time series. From these four quantities, estimates can be made of MSY, stock size at MSY, optimal effort at MSY, optimal fishing mortality at MSY, and the time series of stock biomass levels, surplus production levels, and fishing mortality levels. he general optimization approach is similar to that used by Pella and Timplinson in their GENPROD computer program; however ASPIC uses an analytical solution of the yield equation, a revised loss function , and incorporates several other refinements including bootstrap estimates of variability. The method handles missing data (years with no fishery) correctly without modification and is extremely flexible in handling different patterns of fishing, such a (i) two or more simultaneous fisheries with different types of gear (ii) a fishery that ends and then resumes with a different type of gear, (iii) density-dependent catchability; and (iv) time trends in catchability. The model can be adapted easily to use auxiliary information (e.g. external estimates of population biomass) to tune the model. The major advantages of the ASPIC model are as follows; it is a true non-solution of the production equations; it retains true population persistence; it eliminates the need to use catch-per-unit-effort as an index of abundance, a practive that has been criticized on statistical grounds; and it can be modified easily. The paper describes the structure of the model and its performance on several simulated and real data sets.},

The Fox model is more realistic for fish populations than the Schaefer, eliminating the constraint of a symmetrical yield curve. The Pella–Tomlinson model is general, including the others as special instances. Tests against data from laboratory populations of guppies support the validity of the Fox and Pella–Tomlinson models. The Fox model is the simpler to fit of the two (as it has less parameters) and has been shown to be appropriate for a number of commercial fisheries. Advantages of the models include their minimal requirements for basic data and relative ease of fitting.

  abstract = {Surplus production modelling has a long history as a method for managing data-limited fish stocks. Recent advancements have cast surplus production models as state-space models that separate random variability of stock dynamics from error in observed indices of biomass. We present a stochastic surplus production model in continuous time (SPiCT), which in addition to stock dynamics also models the dynamics of the fisheries. This enables error in the catch process to be reflected in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters and management quantities. Benefits of the continuous-time state-space model formulation include the ability to provide estimates of exploitable biomass and fishing mortality at any point in time from data sampled at arbitrary and possibly irregular intervals. We show in a simulation that the ability to analyse subannual data can increase the effective sample size and improve estimation of reference points relative to discrete-time analysis of aggregated annual data. Finally, subannual data from five North Sea stocks are analysed with particular focus on using residual analysis to diagnose model insufficiencies and identify necessary model extensions such as robust estimation and incorporation of seasonality. We argue that including all known sources of uncertainty, propagation of that uncertainty to reference points and checking of model assumptions using residuals are critical prerequisites to rigorous fish stock management based on surplus production models.},

The iterative method of Levenberg-Marquardt was applied to two versions of the restructured model: five parameters were estimated in the first version and three in the second, the latter preventing degeneracy of the model to exponential form. We discuss in particular the causes of the degeneracies associated with previous applications of the model. Such faults lie, inherently, with the mathematical indeterminacy of the system equations themselves, so that all nonlinear estimation methods will tend to be inefficient in the absence of external constraints. The effectiveness of the Levenberg-Marquardt method was eva'\textbackslash{}uated by Monte-Carlo simulation. As examples, we analyzed catch-effort data from the yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern Pacific and catch-effort data from the Pacific halibut fishery (Area 2 of the International Pacific Halibut Commission).},

It is a spatial and weekly model during 1997–2014 that utilizes within-season depletion based on catch per unit of effort (CPUE; kg·pot–1) and also biomass values from a survey designed speciﬁcally for this stock. The model is formulated in a state-space framework. The main contribution of the model is to provide a better understanding of ﬁshery-dependent factors that affect CPUE. There is strong evidence of density dependence in the relationship with CPUE and stock biomass, in addition to a general increase in CPUE catchability over time that may be related to changes in gear soak time and spatial variation in catchability. We also ﬁnd that a natural mortality rate of 0.4 provides a better ﬁt to survey results. Model results suggest that there is no evidence of effort saturation in the ﬁshery.},

Since different types of errors propagate through these processes, it can be difﬁcult to identify a particular family of distributions for modelling errors on observations a priori. By implementing several observational likelihoods, modelling both numbers- and proportions-at-age, in an age-based state-space stock assessment model, we compare the model ﬁt for each choice of likelihood along with the implications for spawning stock biomass and mean ﬁshing mortality. We propose using AIC intervals based on ﬁtting the full observational model for comparing different observational likelihoods. Using data from four stocks, we show that the model ﬁt is improved by modelling the correlation of observations within years. However, the best choice of observational likelihood differs for different stocks, and the choice is important for the short-term conclusions drawn from the assessment model; in particular, the choice can inﬂuence total allowable catch advise based on reference points.},

Since the statistical framework is defined by observational processes, observational parameters enter into the estimation and must be considered random, similarly to parameters or states of interest like population levels or real catches. The former are thus perceived as nuisance parameters whose values are intrinsically linked to the considered experiment, which also require noninformative priors. In fishery research Jeffreys methodology has been presented by Millar (2002) as a practical way to elicit such priors. However they can present wrong properties in multiparameter contexts. Therefore we suggest to use the elicitation method proposed by Berger and Bernardo to avoid paradoxical results raised by Jeffreys priors. These benchmark priors are derived here in the framework of sequential population analysis.},

In particular, f 0.1) TACs can be severely overestimated, although the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is relatively well determined over a wide range of values of the ratio.

The traditional surplus production model incorporates the assumption that catch per unit of effort is constant for a given stock size. As a result, effort can be indefinitely applied to the fishery in the short term, and catch would indefinitely increase at a constant rate. In this paper, a surplus production bioeconomic model is developed using a nonlinear form of the short-run catch equation based on the Spillman production function. Two long-run models were derived using the logistic and exponential growth models. The parameters for the long-run equilibrium models are estimated from catch and effort data using a disequilibrium form of the model. The models were applied to data for the Hawaiian lobster fishery used in the analysis by Clarke, Yoshimoto, and Pooley (1992). The results were compared with the results derived from conventional forms of the surplus production model. The key parameter values were similar to those reported by Clarke, Yoshimoto, and Pooley, but the amount of variation in the data explained by the new formulation of the models was generally higher.},

The model employs a production function that differs from the canonical logistic (Schaefer) and Gompertz (Fox) functions, but is still connected to the Pella–Tomlinson formulation. We embed this function in a state-space model, using observed catch-per-unit-effort indices and measures of fishing effort as input. From the literature we derive Bayesian prior densities for all model hyperparameters (carrying capacity, catchability, growth rate and error variance), as well as the state (annual stock biomass). We use the well-studied Namibian hake fishery as a case study, via which we compare the Schaefer, Fox and Pella–Tomlinson models with the new model. We also develop a package for the software R, which employs a Shiny application for data exploration, model specification, and output analyses. Posterior densities of hyperparameters and reference points agree across models. Identifiability issues emerge in the more cumbersome Pella–Tomlinson model. The new model yields small but consistent improvements in precision. It also renders implementation faster and easier, with no hidden truncation of negative biomasses. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical extensions to this new model.},

We derive conditions on the environmental noise distribution that insure that the biomass process for an SPM has a stationary distribution, so that extinction is avoided. Explicit results about the stationary behavior of the biomass distribution are provided for a particular specification of the noise. The consideration of random noise in the MSY calculations leads to more conservative harvesting target than deterministic models. The derivations account for a possible noise autocorrelation that represents the occurrence of spells of good and bad years. The impact of the noise is found to be more severe on Pella Tomlinson model for which the asymmetry parameter p is large while it is less important for Fox model.},

  abstract = {Environmental processes resolved at a suﬃciently small scale in space and time will inevitably display non-stationary behavior. Such processes are both challenging to model and computationally expensive when the data size is large. Instead of modeling the global non-stationarity explicitly, local models can be applied to disjoint regions of the domain. The choice of the size of these regions is dictated by a bias-variance trade-oﬀ; large regions will have smaller variance and larger bias, whereas small regions will have higher variance and smaller bias. From both the modeling and computational point of view, small regions are preferable to better accommodate the non-stationarity. However, in practice, large regions are necessary to control the variance. We propose a novel Bayesian three-step approach that allows for smaller regions without compromising the increase of the variance that would follow. We are able to propagate the uncertainty from one step to the next without issues caused by reusing the data. The improvement in inference also results in improved prediction, as our simulated example shows. We illustrate this new approach on a data set of simulated high-resolution wind speed data over Saudi Arabia.},

  abstract = {Background: Global regression models under an implicit assumption of spatial stationarity were commonly applied to estimate the environmental effects on aquatic species distribution. However, the relationships between species distribution and environmental variables may change among spatial locations, especially at large spatial scales with complicated habitat. Local regression models are appropriate supplementary tools to explore species-environment relationships at ﬁner scales.
Method: We applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) models on Yellow Perch in Lake Erie to estimate spatially-varying environmental effects on the presence probabilities of this species. Outputs from GWR were compared with those from generalized additive models (GAMs) in exploring the Yellow Perch distribution. Local regression coefﬁcients from the GWR were mapped to visualize spatially-varying species-environment relationships. K-means cluster analyses based on the t-values of GWR local regression coefﬁcients were used to characterize the distinct zones of ecological relationships.
Results: Geographically weighted regression resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement over the GAM in goodness-of-ﬁt and accuracy of model prediction. Results from the GWR revealed the magnitude and direction of environmental effects on Yellow Perch distribution changed among spatial locations. Consistent species-environment relationships were found in the west and east basins for adults. The different kinds of species-environment relationships found in the central management unit (MU) implied the variation of relationships at a scale ﬁner than the MU.
Conclusions: This study draws attention to the importance of accounting for spatial nonstationarity in exploring species-environment relationships. The GWR results can provide support for identiﬁcation of unique stocks and potential reﬁnement of the current jurisdictional MU structure toward more ecologically relevant MUs for the sustainable management of Yellow Perch in Lake Erie.},

  abstract = {1. Estimating temporal trends in animal abundance is central to ecology and conservation, but obtaining useful trend estimates is challenging when animal detection rates vary across surveys (e.g. because of differences in observers or conditions). Methods exist for obtaining abundance estimates using capture–recapture and distance sampling protocols, but only recently have some of these been extended to allow direct estimation of abundance trends when detection rates vary. Extensions to distance sampling for {$>$}2 surveys have not yet been demonstrated. 2. We demonstrate a Bayesian approach for estimating abundance and population trends, using a time series of line-transect data for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus off the west coast of the United States. We use a hierarchical model to partition state and observation processes. Population density is modelled as a function of covariates and random process terms, while observed counts are modelled as an overdispersed Poisson process with rates estimated as a function of population density and detection probability, which is modelled using distance sampling theory. We used Deviance Information Criteria to make multi-model inference about abundance and trend estimates. 3. Bayesian posterior distributions for trend parameters provide strong evidence of increasing fin whale abundance in the California Current study area from 1991 to 2008, while individual abundance estimates during survey years were considerably more precise than previously reported estimates using the same data. Assuming no change in underlying population dynamics, we predict continued increases in fin whale numbers over the next decade. Our abundance projections account for both sampling error in parameter estimates and process variance in annual abundance about the mean trend. 4. Synthesis and applications. Bayesian hierarchical modelling offers numerous benefits for analysing animal abundance trends. In our case, these included its implicit handling of sampling covariance, flexibility to accommodate random effects and covariates, ability to compare trend models of different functional forms and ability to partition sampling and process error to make predictions. Ultimately, by placing distance sampling within a more general hierarchical framework, we obtained more precise abundance estimates and an inference about fin whale trends that would have otherwise been difficult.},
